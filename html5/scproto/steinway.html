    <p> Steinway Recording is a dedicated recording facility for a new Steinway model B grand piano. Using top quality
        microphones, preamps and software we offer top quality piano recording at an extremely competitive price.
    </p>

    <p> I engineer and produce recordings for visiting musicians or, as a pianist, can extend this to sessions entirely
        conducted over the internet.
    </p>

    <p> For recording piano there is nothing more inspiring than the real thing and when it is a Steinway piano there is
        nothing better. The Steinway piano has become the standard by which others are judged with its uncompromising
        sound and perfect touch.
    </p>

    <p> The instrument is a new Steinway model B (6’11” / 211 cm) number 579089 acquired from Steinway in 2007. This
        piano was selected from several model Bs in Steinway Hall, London for its balance of tone across the whole
        range. The action was immediately re-pinned, set up and regulated by the renowned Steinway technician Jeff Prett
        - a standard procedure for these world class pianos to ensure an absolute eveness of touch and tone for the
        pianist. Regular tuning, regulation and maintenance is carried out by Steinway trained technician Peter Roscoe.
    </p>

    <p> The purpose built studio uses heat recovery fresh air ventilation to maintain an extremely stable temperature
        and humidity whereby fresh air is diffused within the studio through a bespoke air diffusion sock. This achieves
        draught free and silent ventilation - a very comfortable environment in which to perform and create.
    </p>

    <p> We have plenty of room available for accommodation in our neighbouring farmhouse if required.
