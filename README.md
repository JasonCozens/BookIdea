# Book Ideas
Ideas for a book about writing high quality software.

## Purpose

I'd like to write a book about computing / software development that acts as a showcase for my skills.

* HTML5 and CSS

# FoundationPress

FoundationPress combines the blogging/webste platform Wordpress with the presenation framework Zurb Fooundation.

Wordpress is a platform for creating blogs and websites.
It uses te following technolgies:

* html
* css
* php
* MySQL

A key feature of Wordpress is that it separates content from presentation.
Simply viewed the content is stored is a database whilst the presentation is managed using themes.
There is a well tested UI for managing the content.
It is possible to radically change the look of a Wordpress site by changing its theme.

Foundation is a html presentantio framework.
Presentation frameworks implement common UI components using a library of CSS classes.
In FoundationPress, Foundatio is used to build te themes.
